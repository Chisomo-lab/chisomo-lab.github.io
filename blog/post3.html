  <h1>Understanding Creative Commons & Public Domain for Film</h1>
  <p class="muted">A clear, practical guide to common licenses and what they allow.</p>
  <p>For creators and educators, understanding the difference between public domain and Creative Commons is essential. This article explains the basics and offers practical advice for reuse.</p>
  <h2>Public Domain</h2>
  <p>Public domain works are free for anyone to use without permission. In many jurisdictions, older works (for example, works published in the U.S. before 1928) are now in the public domain, but the rules vary by country. Always check the specific provenance and any notes on restoration or new elements that might still be copyrighted.</p>
  <h2>Creative Commons licenses</h2>
  <p>Creative Commons (CC) provides a family of licenses that let creators grant permissions in advance. Key flavors you'll encounter:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CC BY</strong> â€” Allows reuse including commercial, provided attribution is given.</li>
    <li><strong>CC BY-SA</strong> â€” Same as CC BY but derivative works must be shared under the same license.</li>
    <li><strong>CC BY-NC</strong> â€” Allows reuse only for non-commercial purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>CC0</strong> â€” Creator waives all rights and effectively places the work in the public domain.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Practical steps for reuse</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Always note the exact license text and follow any attribution requirements.</li>
    <li>For CC BY and CC BY-SA, include a clear credit line (title, author, license, link to license).</li>
    <li>For CC BY-NC, avoid commercial uses unless you seek permission.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Attribution example</h2>
  <p>Correct attribution: <em>Title</em> by <em>Author</em> (Year) â€” CC BY 4.0 â€” https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>
  <h2>Closing</h2>
  <p>Licensing can seem complex, but with simple checks you can confidently reuse archival footage for education and creative projects. When in doubt, reach out to the uploader or archive for clarification.</p>
