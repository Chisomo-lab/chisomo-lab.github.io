  <h1>Top 10 Educational Documentaries You Can Use in Class</h1>
  <p class="muted">A selection of documentaries available in public archives or under open licenses, with classroom use notes.</p>
  <p>Below are ten documentaries (or documentary-style films) that we consider particularly useful for classroom settings. Each entry includes a short description and suggested learning activities.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Historical Newsreels Collection</strong> â€” Short clips useful for primary-source analysis. Activity: ask students to compare perspectives in different years.</li>
    <li><strong>Science & Nature: Early Educational Films</strong> â€” Great for introductory lessons on scientific method; pair with modern resources to show how presentation has changed.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Issues Documentaries</strong> â€” Use as a prompt for debate and research assignments.</li>
    <li><strong>Local History Features</strong> â€” Project idea: students produce a short documentary about their community using archival footage.</li>
    <li><strong>Art & Culture Profiles</strong> â€” Use for cross-disciplinary lessons with music and art classes.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology & Innovation</strong> â€” Show the evolution of technology and discuss the social impacts.</li>
    <li><strong>Agricultural Training Films</strong> â€” Historical approach to rural education; compare with modern techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Health & Public Safety Films</strong> â€” Useful for discussions about public communication and trust in science.</li>
    <li><strong>Migration & Labor Reports</strong> â€” Analyze economic and social drivers in primary sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Biographical Shorts</strong> â€” inspiring profiles that can prompt research projects.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How to use these films effectively</h2>
  <p>Always provide context: when the film was made, who produced it, and what biases might be present. Prepare guiding questions, and if possible, include short assignments that require timestamps and citations to teach good research habits.</p>
  <p>Finally, pair archival films with modern commentary or recent studies so students can compare past narratives with present knowledge.</p>
